# Project: Birthright Genesys Conversion

## Goal
Rebuild the AD&D 2nd Edition *Birthright* campaign setting for the **Genesys RPG system**.  
Start from the original sourcebooks and translate mechanics, lore, and setting elements into Genesys’ narrative dice framework.  
All earlier drafts (2020) are ignored; this is a full restart.

## Scope
1. **System Translation**
   - Convert AD&D mechanics (attributes, bloodlines, magic, domain rules) to Genesys equivalents.
   - Maintain Birthright’s tone: dynastic politics, divine heritage, and domain management.
   - Ensure all rules remain mechanically balanced within Genesys’ core systems.

2. **World Conversion**
   - Rebuild Cerilia’s nations, deities, geography, and culture in modular Genesys-ready sections.
   - Include domain-level play for regents, warfare, and diplomacy.
   - Provide rewritten lore summaries free of D&D rule references.

3. **Core Rule Adaptations**
   - **Species:** Anuirean, Brecht, Khinasi, Rjurik, Vos, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, etc.  
   - **Careers & Archetypes:** Adapt Birthright classes into Genesys-compatible careers.  
   - **Magic:** Define Bloodline & True Magic systems that fit Genesys’ spellcasting model.  
   - **Domain Play:** Create a structured subsystem for rulership, diplomacy, and warfare.

4. **Deliverables**
   - `/docs/Birthright_Genesys_Core.md` — Base rules and mechanics  
   - `/docs/Cerilia_Guide.md` — Nations, culture, and factions  
   - `/docs/Domain_Rules.md` — Regency and rulership system  
   - `/docs/Player_Reference.pdf` — Summarized player handout  
   - Future: GM screen, talent cards, and starter adventures

## Source Material
Upload directly into this repo:
- Birthright Rulebook (AD&D 2e)
- Ruins of Empire
- Book of Priestcraft
- Book of Magecraft
- Atlas of Cerilia
- Domain/Bloodline appendices

## Copilot / ChatGPT Guidelines
- Focus on **mechanical translation**, not reproduction of AD&D text.  
- Preserve names, geography, and tone; rewrite in original language.  
- Follow **Genesys Core Rulebook** design patterns.  
- Use Markdown tables for stats and derived values.  
- Label content clearly for automation (e.g., `### Species: Anuirean`).  
- Maintain concise, technical rulebook prose.

## Non-Goals
- No copyrighted AD&D text.  
- No unrelated homebrew or crossover material.  
- No reuse from unofficial fan conversions.

## Future Expansion
- Integrate with Foundry VTT and/or PDF publication pipeline.  
- Optional cross-compatibility with Terrinoth and other Genesys settings.
